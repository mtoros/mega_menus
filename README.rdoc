= MegaMenus

== DESCRIPTION:

This gem makes working with menu structures in Rails easier. 

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:
The current version creates:
* a controller for editing the menu
  * views associated to methods written in rjs
  * a partial for rendering the menu(for example to be rendered from a menu)
  * a helper to configure its working in normal mode and edit mode, selection of menu depths(levels) to be shown 
  * the builtin functions are (add, delete, edit, move up, move down)
* a model for storing the menu with fields absolute_position and depth to improve performance when the menu is in normal mode
* a generator for rails to ease the developers work for using this gem, the menu generator creates a template menu structure that the developer can customize.
* uses session[:menu_id] to identify the selected menu
* possibility to render different menu depths in different places
* added a publish button in order to hide or set visible menus (publish model field)


== STATUS
* Currently writing tests to ensure proper working for future versions.


== REQUIREMENTS:
* Rails 2.2 

== NOTES:
* You can have multiple partials rendering different parts of the menu. Include in your partial the following line:
  - <% mega_menus(name_of_the_menu_model, 'name_of_the_menu_controller', par, arr, parent_id) %>
  - where par is the either TRUE(editor mode) or FALSE(normal mode), arr is an array containing the interval of depths to be shown(2..3 means display menus with depths 2 and 3), parent_id determines to which parent are this children related to( 5 would mean show only children whoose ancestor has id parent_id)
* If you have multiple partials you should edit the rjs files in order to assure proper updating of each partial. By default only the generated partial is updated.

* The menu is  located in <ul id="ul_menu_#{m.depth}" class="ul_menu_depth_#{m.depth}">
* The selected menu is located in <li class="li_menu_class_selected">
* This two id and class values can be easly changed by editing the mega_menu partial and its helper.

== INSTALL:
* script/generate menu menu_name
